# I. Geometric Distribution. 

### Provide an R code for the geometric distribution. The geometric distribution is a probability distribution that models the number of trials required to achieve the first success in a sequence of Bernoulli trials, where each trial has a constant probability of success.

```{r}
# 1. Set the probability of success
p <- 0.2

# 2. Generate 1000 random variables from the geometric distribution
x <- rgeom(1000, p) + 1

# 3.  Calculate basic statistics
mean_x <- mean(x)
var_x <- var(x)
sd_x <- sd(x)

# 4. Print the results with formatted output
cat("Number of trials required to achieve first success:\n")
cat(sprintf("Mean (in 2 decimal places): %.2f\n", mean_x))
cat(sprintf("Variance (in 2 decimal places): %.2f\n", var_x))
cat(sprintf("Standard deviation (in 2 decimal places): %.2f\n", sd_x))

# 5. Plot the histogram
hist(x, breaks = 30, main = "Histogram of Trials to First Success",
     xlab = "Number of Trials", col = "blue", border = "white")

```
